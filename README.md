# SolarSight
SolarSight: An Intelligent Framework for Automated Detection of Surface Defects in Solar PV Panels

## Purpose
Train and evaluate machine learning models (classical and deep learning) for detecting defects in PV solar panel images. The original notebook uses scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (Keras), OpenCV and scikit-image for preprocessing and modeling.


## Dataset
